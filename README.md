Our finding is that SMT-VIS connectivity is weakly but significantly increased over the average of 2 years between scans.

Many SMT or VIS regions are more predictive of scan age than average.

# FC Increases in Cross-Sectional Data

We find that FC significantly increases overall in cross-sectional data with age, although not moreso in SMT-VIS compared to other regions. This raises the possibility of a change in scanner task during the second longitudinal scan.

# How to Use

Requires jupyter notebook and common python packages (no requirements.txt, they are very standard).

Navigate to notebook directory and examine code.

Unfortunately, due to UKB data sharing poliy, we are unable to share the data.
