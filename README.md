# ukb-longitudinal-smt-vis

Code for analysis of UKB longitudinal data (2,722 subjects).

Our finding is that SMT-VIS connectivity is weakly but significantly increased over the average of 2 years between scans.

Many SMT or VIS regions are more predictive of scan age than average.

# How to Use

Requires jupyter notebook and common python packages (no requirements.txt, they are very standard).

Navigate to notebook directory and examine code.

Unfortunately, due to UKB data sharing poliy, we are unable to share the data.
